# ServiceLayer

Service Layer Pattern Implementation.

Provide an easy way to write service layer object.  
Services are used to encapsulate application logic business.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'service_layer'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install service_layer

## Usage

```ruby
class MatchingService < ApplicationService
  property :tender
  render :matches_created

  def perform
    # business logic
  end
end
```
```ruby
class TendersController < ApplicationController
  def update
    @tender = Tender.find(params[:id])
    result = MatchingService.perform(tender: @tender)

    respond_to do |format|
      if result.success?
        format.html { redirect_to tender_path(@tender), status: :see_other }
      else
        format.html do
          flash.now[:message] = t(result.error.message)
          render :edit
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

## Configuration

### Monad adapter

May be set to one of `[:dry, :without]`. `:without` is the default one but also
deprecated. Override with `:dry`.

```ruby
# config/initializers/service_layer.rb
 
ServiceLayer.configure do |config|
  config.monad = :dry
end
```
